# 📰 Fake News Classifier

A machine learning project to classify news articles as **real** or **fake**.  
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning models.

---

## ✨ Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization).
- Multiple machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Jupyter Notebook included for step-by-step explanation.

## 🧠 Models Used
- **Logistic Regression** → A simple yet effective linear model that works well for binary classification tasks like detecting fake vs. real news.  
- **Naive Bayes** → A probabilistic model based on Bayes’ theorem. It is very efficient for text classification problems because it assumes feature independence.  
- **Random Forest** → An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for better accuracy and robustness.  
- **XGBoost** → A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that is optimized for speed and performance. It often achieves high accuracy in classification tasks.
